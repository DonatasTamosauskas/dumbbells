# Deep Reinforcement Learning with OpenAI Gym
By Adrian Ruvalcaba, Donatas Tamo≈°auskas, Zaid Al Nouman

## Code structure:
The "dumbbells" folder contains all code for training the models. 

The "notebooks" folder contains two Jupyter notebooks, Train and Test, that allow you to easily and quickly run our code. Training will create files in notebooks/model that store the weights of the mode. These weights can then be used in the Test Jupyter notebook by copying and pasting the file name, excluding the "_model_weights.model". Or, you can simply test using our optimized model weights by simply running the Test Jupyter notebook without changing anything!
